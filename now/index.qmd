This is my [now page](https://nownownow.com/about); I can't promise how up-to-date it is, but at least the last-updated date is printed!

## What I'm Thinking About

This list is not identical to what my group^[The people who do the real work, [my students and postdocs](https://viveks.bee.cornell.edu/people/index.html).] is working on; these are things I'm thinking about myself or with collaborators, at varying levels of maturity.

- Changing meteorological extremes and their impacts on power system reliability, particularly correlated extremes across variables and/or space;
- Probabilistic depth-damage relationships and implications for flood risk assessment;
- Partial pooling of tide gauge measurements;
- Ethical-epistemic implications of information criteria-based model selection;
- Adaptive sampling for a variety of design-of-experiment problems with complex, high-dimensional model frameworks.
- Quantifying the life-cycle implications, costs, and benefits of approaches to solar radiation management and/or carbon sequestration given future CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and Earth-system uncertainties.
- Compound risks facing urban systems.

I'm [open to collaboration](../contact/index.qmd) on any of these topics, or anything else that you think I could contribute to.

I'm also trying to force myself to do write some notebooks about these and other topics; we'll see how successful that is.
