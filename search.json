I am also a member of the Civil & Environmental Engineering, Systems Engineering, and Atmospheric Sciences graduate fields. I received a Ph.D. in Energy & Mineral Engineering from Penn State in 2018.\nMy research focuses on managing climate risk, particularly in how climate- and human-system uncertainties and human responses to environmental hazards influence the efficacy of climate risk management strategies. The overarching goal of this research is to help design robust approaches to reducing the impacts of climate change. I work on both mitigation (the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions) and adaptation, particularly focusing on flood risk and energy-system reliability. I am also deeply committed to open science and maximizing research transparency and reproducibility, which are essential for building credibility in climate risk projections and associated risk-management interventions. For more information on my research, please see my research group’s website.\nI teach courses on environmental systems and environmental data analysis and statistics. All of my course materials are open-source and I welcome questions and feedback. I’ve also taught several other courses; for more information, see my teaching page"
